# Objective Valence and Arousal Detection Using Extreme Learning Machines on EEG
Machine learning models to recognize the four quartiles of the valence-arousal space using the DEAP database for EEG

# Instructions
There are two folders included in this submission. The python folder was used to play around with elm implementation on python. The matlab folder is the one that has the actual code that was used to generate the figures used in the presentation and the document
