#Introduction
TEAP was written during a bachelor project at [University of 
Geneva](http://cui.unige.ch) by Frank Villaro-Dixon. The main reason for TEAP 
was that we wanted a Matlab toolbox for Emotion Analysis using Physiological 
signals (hence it's name).  Indeed, some PhD students used various scripts for 
different things, and it was a mess sharing those scripts. TEAP's goal was to 
unify all that.


Briefly, TEAP consists of 100 `.m` files (1700 lines of code + 1000 lines of 
comments) and works quite well. We hope you'll enjoy-it.

Down below is some documentation on how to use TEAP.
