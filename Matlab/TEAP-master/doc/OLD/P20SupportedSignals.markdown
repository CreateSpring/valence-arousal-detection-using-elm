Here is the list of signals that are actually supported by TEAP:

You can also read the list at `src/README.md`

##BVP (Blood Volume Pressure)
* BPM
* mean
* std
* var

##ECG (ElectroCardioGram)
* IBImean
* IBIvar

##EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram)
* bandENR

##GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)
* peaks

##HST (Human Skin Temperature)
* mean derivative
* mean

##RES (RESpiration)
* energy
* main frequency
* min/max

##DMY
This is a sample dummy signal, not useful to you, unless you want to contribute 
to TEAP a bit ;)
