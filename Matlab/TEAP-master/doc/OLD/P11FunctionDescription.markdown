##Description of TEAP's functions

We can divide TEAP functions into two parts:

* **User functions**: XXX\_YYY\_ZZZ
* **Toolbox functions**: XXX\_\_YYY\_ZZZ

The functions you want to know are the **user functions**, that is the ones that 
are useful to you. The toolbox functions (the ones containing *2 trailing 
underscores*) are specific to TEAP, and you shouldn't have to use them (except 
if you want to add a feature to TEAP).
